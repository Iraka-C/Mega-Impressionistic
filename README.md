This is a project inspired by Starry Night.<br/>
We referred to the work of [InteractiveStarryNight](https://github.com/DomonJi/InteractiveStarryNight)
 and implemented a gradient field based particle animation for any input image.

You can do these in index.html:<br/>
1. Drag an image into the browser window and after a short time a real-time computed animation will appear.<br/>
2. Change the parameters by the top-left toolbox. Simply SCROLL on the number or options to apply adjustments.<br/>
3. Drag on the canvas to draw your own fluid. The option "Radius" is to control the width of the mouse stroke.<br/>
4. On the welcome page, click on "Drag an image to here" to check this sentence.
 This will instruct the program to use a [Customized Field](https://github.com/DomonJi/InteractiveStarryNight/blob/master/data/field.txt)
 aiming at the painting Starry Night rather than an auto generated field. We appreciate [DomonJi](https://github.com/DomonJi) for his works.<br/>
5. On the welcome page, click on "Custom field" to check the box.
 This will apply an empty field at first. You can then use your mouse to draw on the canvas to direct the fluid.<br/>
